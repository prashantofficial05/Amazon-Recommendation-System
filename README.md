# Amazon-Recommendation-System
    Recommendation Systems are one of the widely used applications of data science in most companies, based on products and online services. Amazon is a great example of such companies. Being an online shopping 
    website Amazon needs to generate personalised recommendations to provide a better user experience. 

    The Recommendation System of Amazon follows the principle of generating product-based recommendations, measuring the similarities between two products and then recommending the most similar products to each 
    user. The methods of measuring similarities between two products have always been a major focus of researchers.

    But when it comes to a website like Amazon, it needs to add more criteria to recommend products to the users such as the quality of the product. A good quality product will always have a good collection of 
    reviews so we can use both the similarity score and product reviews to generate recommendations. 

    I will try to use the fewer Python libraries I can for creating this recommendation system. To work with data I will be using only pandas and NumPy library in Python. So letâ€™s import the data and see how to 
    create an Amazon Recommendation System using Python
